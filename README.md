# Sushi log
- This directory logs my sushi eating. For Japanease, sushi is a special dish, and we often eat sushi at celebration days and feel high motivation from sushi.
- Personally I everytime goes to sushi restaurants after boxing exercise. Sushi is high protein and low fat food, which is desirable for sportsperson.
- To monitor performance of boxing exercise or other sports, it might be intractable due to their various activities, or boring. (I stopped monitoring several times.) However, sushi monitoring is (expected to be) super fun for Japanese.
- I'm not 100% sure what is the best way to log sushi and it might have seasonarity, (sushi is tasty in winter and I prefer stakes than sushi in summer), Let's try to log sth on GitHub.

## In Logging
- Sara (dishes): if I go to kaiten-sushi (dishes are moving in restaurants), I will count sara. If not, I count the number of orders here.
- notional (JPY): JPY notional. for simplicity, I include the Japan consumpsion tax (10% rate) here.
